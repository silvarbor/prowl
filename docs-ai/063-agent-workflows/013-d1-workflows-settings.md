# 063.013 — Settings › Workflows, `workflows.md`, and CLI Reachability (D1, rest)

## Status

Drafted 2026-09-04 on `feat/workflow-settings-d1`; implemented and opened as
[#761](https://github.com/onevcat/Prowl/pull/761) the same day. D1's authoring skill shipped ahead of the
slice as `prowl-workflow` (#754); this record covers the remaining D1 scope from the
[release plan](release-plan.md): the Settings › Agents › **Workflows** page, the agent-facing
manual `docs/components/workflows.md`, and the CLI reachability status deferred from C0
([002](002-settings-agents-group.md)). The design was frozen by [000-plan](000-plan.md) (UI
section: "Settings information architecture", "CLI reachability status"; slice table row D1)
and by C2's decision 5 ([011](011-c2-start-sheet.md)); the decisions below fill the gaps the
plan left to implementation.

## Product contract

R2a/C2 left every workflow *setting* hidden: `disabledWorkflowIDs` had no toggle, the tri-state
bind-mode override was written only by the sheet's "Don't ask again", remembered role
bindings could be corrected only through "Run with Options…", validation errors were visible
only to `prowl workflow validate`, and a user whose `prowl` could not reach the app saw a
healthy-looking Settings page. D1 closes that:

- **Settings › Agents › Workflows** (between Profiles and CLI & Skills, per the plan's IA):
  - a CLI dependency banner at the top — Install inline when `prowl` is not installed, the
    socket failure reason when Prowl is not listening (no Install for that);
  - **Built-in**, **Your Workflows** (`~/.prowl/workflows`), and **Repositories**
    (`<root>/.prowl/workflows` of every open repository that has files) lists;
  - per row: enable checkbox (`disabledWorkflowIDs`, keyed `<scope>/<id>`), icon/name/id/
    description, validation status with the diagnostics (`line:column message code`), an
    "Overridden by <file>" / "Overridden in <repository>" note when another definition wins
    the id, **Reveal**;
  - per row with `launch` roles: the **Bindings** picker (Follow file / Always ask /
    Automatic — C2's tri-state) and one profile picker per launch role showing the remembered
    profile (editable: pick a qualifying profile or "Ask at start"), with **Manage Profiles…**
    jumping to Settings › Profiles;
  - **New Workflow…** writes a validated starter file to `~/.prowl/workflows/` and reveals it;
    **Ask an Agent…** hands over a copyable prompt (localized like Help › Ask Agent About
    Prowl) that points the agent at the bundled `prowl-workflow` skill and manual;
  - the lists refresh when the watched directories change, so editing a file in an editor
    updates its validation status without leaving Settings.
- **Settings › Agents › CLI & Skills › Connection** gains a **Status** row: Listening /
  Not running / failed with the reason (another instance, permissions, path too long, …).
- **Workflow start preflight**: the start sheet's banner and the immediate-start gate use the
  same reachability signal — a socket failure blocks Run with its reason.
- **`docs/components/workflows.md`**: the manual page for the feature (what a workflow is,
  sources, entry points, the start sheet, the status center, Settings, run directory, CLI
  pointers), indexed from `docs/README.md`; `settings.md`, `settings-fields.md`, `cli.md`,
  and the C2 entry-point pages cross-link it.

## Decisions taken for implementation

1. **Reachability is a status the server owns, read through a dependency client.**
   `CLISocketServer` publishes `CLIServiceStatus` (`stopped` / `listening(path)` /
   `failed(CLIServiceError, path)`) through a main-actor publisher; `CLIServiceStatusClient`
   exposes `current`. Settings reads it when the page appears (as `refreshCLIInstallStatus`);
   the workflow start context assembly reads it for the preflight. No stream is wired: the
   status changes only at start and quit in V1, and a stream nobody consumes is dead weight.
2. **The Workflows page is a TCA child of `SettingsFeature`** (`WorkflowsSettingsFeature`),
   created on selection and torn down on leaving it — the `AgentSkillsFeature` shape — so
   the directory watcher is cancelled with the page. Row derivation is a pure builder
   (`WorkflowSettingsCatalog`) over discovery entries + `UserGlobalSettings`, tested without
   the filesystem; the filesystem scan, template creation, Reveal, and watching live in
   `WorkflowSettingsClient`, assembled in `WorkflowSettingsComposition` from the same runtime
   snapshot the start client reads, so both use the same validation inputs (bundled skill
   ids, agent catalog, probes, profiles).
3. **Settings writes workflow fields field-wise into `@Shared(.userGlobalSettings)`**, never
   replacing the whole struct: the Profiles page may be editing `agentProfiles` in another
   window state, and a whole-struct write from here would clobber it.
4. **Repository workflows are listed per repository, only for repositories that have files.**
   An empty section per open repository would be noise; a single note says where files go.
   The disabled key stays `<scope>/<id>` (B1's contract), so the same id in two repositories
   shares one toggle — documented, not "fixed": a per-repository key would change the CLI's
   `list` semantics, which is out of D1's scope.
5. **Remembered bindings are editable here because nothing else can reset them.** The picker
   offers every enabled profile with the resolver's own rejection reason on the ones that do
   not qualify (same rule as the sheet: dimmed, not selectable), keeps a remembered profile
   that was disabled since listed as "Disabled in Settings", and "Ask at start" forgets the
   memory. Setting a profile from Settings writes exactly what a start would have remembered.
6. **New Workflow… reveals rather than opens.** The default app for `.yaml` is unpredictable
   (Xcode, TextEdit, an IDE); revealing the file beside the row that now shows its validation
   status is the safe default, and the row's Reveal does the same later.
7. **Grace values stay constants.** The plan says the watchdog grace periods are "global
   settings (Settings › Workflows)", but they are not in D1's slice contents and B2 grilled
   their defaults; a Watchdog section is a small follow-up once a user needs to move them.
8. **No CLI or contract changes.** `prowl workflow list` already reports `enabled` and
   validation; the page is a GUI over the same data.

## Implementation shape

- `supacode/CLIService/CLIServiceStatus.swift` (+ publisher, client), `CLISocketServer`
  status transitions, `SettingsFeature.cliServiceStatus` + `refreshCLIServiceStatus`,
  Connection status row in `CommandLineToolSettingsView`.
- `supacode/Features/Settings/Reducer/WorkflowsSettingsFeature.swift`,
  `Views/WorkflowsSettingsView.swift`, `SettingsSection.workflows`, sidebar row.
- `supacode/Domain/Workflow/WorkflowSettingsCatalog.swift` (pure rows),
  `WorkflowStarterTemplate.swift` (template + unique file name),
  `supacode/Clients/Workflow/WorkflowSettingsClient.swift` (scan / create / reveal / watch),
  `supacode/Features/Help/WorkflowAuthoringPrompt.swift` (localized prompt),
  `AskAgentHelpView` gains an init over explicit strings.
- `WorkflowStartContext.cliServiceFailure` and the sheet banner variant.
- Docs: `docs/components/workflows.md` (new), `README.md`, `settings.md`,
  `reference/settings-fields.md`, `cli.md`, `command-palette.md`, `active-agents.md`,
  `agent-profiles.md`; the `prowl-workflow` skill mentions the page.

## Review

Adversarial review by the neighbouring Pi reviewer (`prowl agents dispatch` into its pane,
briefs and findings under `/tmp/prowl-d1-review/`), read-only, no builds in the shared
checkout.

- **Round 1 — 2 P1 + 2 P2, all acted on.** P1: the directory vnode watcher missed in-place
  saves (an editor writing a file touches the file's vnode, not the directory's) — every
  discovered file is now watched too, re-armed on each reload, pinned by a real-vnode test.
  P1: a dangling `prowl` link (`.broken`) counted as installed for the Settings banner and the
  start-sheet gate — `CLIInstallStatus.isUsable` (installed or another live build; never
  broken or missing) now drives both, and the banner offers Repair. P2: a `stopped` socket
  status carried no reason, so the start gate treated it as reachable —
  `CLIServiceStatus.unreachableDescription` (nil only while listening) is the gate for the
  sheet and the page; `failureDescription` stays the Connection row's failure text. P2: the
  start composition read the status publisher directly — it now reads the dependency client,
  the same source Settings uses (a composition-level test was not added: the assembly needs
  the app store and terminal manager; the gate itself is covered from the context down).

- **Round 2 — fixes F1–F4 verified; 1 P1 + 1 P2 + 2 P3, all acted on.** P1: `isUsable` on
  the status enum still accepted any occupant of `/usr/local/bin/prowl` — a real file, a
  directory, or a non-executable foreign link — because discovery calls all of them
  `installedDifferentSource`. Usability is now a filesystem probe (`CLIInstallClient.isUsable`:
  the slot, through any symlink, is an executable regular file) used by the page and the
  start composition; the status only names what occupies the slot for the banner's copy and
  button (Install / Repair / Reinstall, `installActionTitle`). P2: the Settings role picker
  filtered out non-qualifying candidates and showed a disabled remembered profile as
  "Missing" — it now lists every enabled profile with the resolver's reason (dimmed,
  `selectionDisabled`, the sheet's contract) and keeps a disabled remembered profile listed
  as "Disabled in Settings"; a deleted one reads "Deleted profile". P3: the start sheet's
  banner said Install for a dangling link — the context now carries the install status and
  the button follows it. P3: the manual claimed parity with `prowl workflow validate`; it now
  says the page adds the availability warnings only the app can evaluate.

- **Round 3 — F5–F8 verified; 0 P0/P1, 2 UX P2, both acted on.** P2: a real file or
  directory in the slot still got a Reinstall button that the installer deterministically
  refuses — `installActionTitle` is nil there, both banners show only the manual-removal
  copy (`workflowBlockerCopy`, shared by the page and the sheet), and the sheet now surfaces
  the installer's own error message instead of a generic line. P2: the picker copy promised
  "the next start will ask" for a disabled or deleted remembered profile, but dsl-spec §3
  falls through to `suggest` and Recommended first — the copy and the manual now say the
  next start picks another eligible profile or asks, and every unavailable entry (the
  current one included) is non-selectable.

- **Round 4 (closing) — F9/F10 verified; no P0, P1, or user-visible P2 remaining.** One P3
  (the manual's start-sheet overview named only two of the four CLI banner states) fixed.

## Verification (all run, 2026-09-04)

- Red-first unit tests, all green on the final head: `CLIServiceStatusTests`, the two new
  `CLISocketServerTests`, `CLIInstallClientTests` (executable probe, action titles),
  `WorkflowChangeWatcherTests` (real vnode sources: in-place edit, missing-directory ancestor),
  `WorkflowSettingsCatalogTests`, `WorkflowStarterTemplateTests`, `WorkflowsSettingsFeatureTests`
  (load, banner precedence, toggle / bind mode / binding memory persistence, New Workflow…,
  debounced reload and teardown on `TestClock`, scan failure), `WorkflowAuthoringPromptTests`,
  and the socket / install-status gating in `SettingsFeatureTests`, `WorkflowStartContextTests`,
  `WorkflowStartFeatureTests`.
- `make check`, `make build-app`, and the full `make test` on the final head: 3042 tests,
  zero failures.
- Isolated Debug instance (temporary home, own `PROWL_CLI_SOCKET`, seeded user and repository
  workflow files, three profiles), driven through `agent-ctrl` AXPress and verified through the
  bundled debug CLI and the settings file: enable checkbox ↔ `disabledWorkflowIDs` ↔
  `prowl workflow list` `enabled`; Bindings popup ↔ `workflowBindModeOverrides`; role picker
  (non-qualifying profile dimmed with its reason and disabled) ↔ `workflowBindings`; New
  Workflow… (file, Valid row, reveal); Ask an Agent… (localized sheet with the bundle's skill
  and manual paths); an in-place append to a watched file turned its row red within a second
  and the revert restored it; Show Details; the Command Palette listed only enabled, valid,
  unshadowed workflows; `prowl workflow run` of a disabled workflow answered
  `WORKFLOW_DISABLED`; CLI & Skills › Connection showed Listening, and a second instance on
  the same socket showed Not listening with the "another instance" reason on both pages.
  Not exercised live: the Install / Repair / Reinstall / occupied-slot banner variants (they
  need `/usr/local/bin/prowl` altered on the machine) — unit-covered.
