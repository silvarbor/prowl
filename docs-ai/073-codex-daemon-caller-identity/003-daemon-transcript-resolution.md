# 073.003 — Daemon Transcript Resolution

## Context

Issue #875 reports that `agents read` loses a daemon-owned session while the user
views old terminal output. The log state provider uses the daemon mapper, but the
session resolver only checks the TUI files and transcript fingerprints.

## Change

- Pass the pane identity into both fresh and background session resolution.
- Reuse the daemon binding when a Codex TUI owns no rollout. Validate the process
  generation across the asynchronous lookup and select only the root transcript
  whose header matches the binding, within the effective `CODEX_HOME`.
- Report `process_log` / `exact`; do not extend the CLI schema or relax confidence.
- Preserve embedded-runtime resolution and the existing fallback when no verified
  binding is available. Do not cache daemon bindings across session transitions.
- Cover old/empty screens, separate panes, session changes, child/fork boundaries,
  and invalid or missing root transcripts. Check the installed runtime and a Debug
  build separately; preserve their distinct evidence.
- Validate a complete metadata line within the existing 1 MiB provider limit;
  real Codex 0.161 metadata can exceed 8 KiB because it contains instructions.
- Fence selected-transcript binding at TUI new/clear/attach reset events. Preserve
  historical submits for caller routing while waiting for a new indexed submit.
  A pending selection explicitly suppresses both the fallback cache and text
  matching, so a fork cannot return its parent transcript through copied history.
  Propagate explicit invalidation to background retention so lists and handoff
  context clear the old identity on the first pending-selection poll. Ordinary
  ambiguous misses retain their existing grace period. Keep the observed fence
  across unstable log reads, scoped to the TUI generation and reset revision.
  Track completed binding separately so later evidence gaps do not become resets;
  reject transcript fallback during those gaps and invalidate pre-selection results.
  Reject client IDs that claim more than one rollout.
- Preserve local open-file resolution when a complete TUI inventory contains an
  owned rollout, even if the same home also has a managed daemon. Otherwise a known
  selection reset suppresses fallback, including when the inventory is incomplete.
  Accepting a daemon binding requires a complete inventory with no TUI-owned rollout.
  Capture the inventory before the live binding lookup, without an early return on
  incomplete inventory, so resets during enumeration invalidate the previous binding.
- Share a bounded parsed TUI-log cache between caller routing and session lookup.
  Check device, inode, size, modification time, and change time on every lookup;
  read and parse only changed files. Validate the snapshot across reads and bound
  reads to 64 MiB. Do not retain prompt bytes or delay selection checks with a TTL.

## Boundary

The mapper identifies a root family after an indexed submit; it is not a complete
TUI selection protocol. Codex 0.161 logs most inbound events by name only, including
startup completion. A future explicit pane-owned selection event can cover the
pre-submit and selected-child cases. Daemon `thread/read` is useful once a thread
ID is known, but `thread/loaded/list` does not supply pane ownership.
