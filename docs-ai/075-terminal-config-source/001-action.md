# 075 — Terminal Config Source and CJK Font Fallback: Action Log

## Timeline

| Date | Change | Ref |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-10-05 | Reproduced the report in a Debug instance: no Ghostty config, `ja-JP`, kana-first Japanese text rendered in BIZ UDGothic with oversized glyphs | — |
| 2026-10-05 | S1: `GhosttyConfigSource`, one config builder, dedicated config file in Settings → General → Terminal Config | #860, [002](002-dedicated-config-file.md) |
| 2026-10-05 | S2: CJK font fallback when the active config sets no font | #861, [003](003-cjk-font-fallback.md) |
| 2026-10-05 | S1 review loop, 3 rounds, clean: the raw `theme` lookup now follows `config-file` includes (`GhosttyRawConfig`), including Ghostty's blank-value reset and root-reload rules | #860 (`ea751a7f`, `24b0cf01`) |
| 2026-10-05 | S2 reuses `GhosttyRawConfig` for font detection instead of its own parser | #861 |
| 2026-10-05 | S2 review round 1: skip a UTF-8 byte order mark in raw config (fix lives in #860), count `--font-family=` / `--font-codepoint-map=` launch arguments as configured fonts | #860 (`24494d37`), #861 |
| 2026-10-05 | S2 review round 2: supplementary ideographs and kana ranges, halfwidth Hangul to the Hangul family, a font set by the active theme counts as configured | #861 |

## Outcome & current state (as of 2026-10-05)

- `App/Sources/Infrastructure/Ghostty/GhosttyConfigSource.swift` — where the user's config
  comes from; loading, the editable file, the raw theme file, and the files to scan.
- `App/Sources/Infrastructure/Ghostty/GhosttyRuntime.swift` — `makeConfig(source:overrideFileURLs:)`
  builds every config: source, CLI args, `TERM_PROGRAM`, CJK fallback, runtime overrides.
- `App/Sources/Infrastructure/Ghostty/GhosttyRawConfig.swift` — raw `key = value` reader
  that follows `config-file` includes like Ghostty; used for the `theme` spec and the font keys.
- `App/Sources/Infrastructure/Ghostty/GhosttyCJKFontFallback.swift` — font detection,
  language choice, and the generated `font-codepoint-map` lines.
- `App/Sources/Features/Settings/Views/TerminalConfigSettingsSection.swift` — Settings UI;
  `GlobalSettings.ghosttyConfigPath` stores the choice.
- User docs: `docs/components/terminal.md` (Ghostty config, CJK font fallback).

## Deviations from plan

- The plan did not say which language list picks the font. The implementation uses a
  `-AppleLanguages` launch argument first, then the global system languages, and ignores
  Prowl's per-app language. The launch argument also makes the behavior testable without
  changing the system language.
- S1 added `~/` display of the dedicated path in Settings.

## Open questions

- A theme found only in a folder that Ghostty searches but Prowl does not list (none known
  on macOS today) would not be checked for fonts.
- A user who sets only `font-family-bold` or `font-family-italic` still gets the mapping;
  Ghostty applies codepoint overrides to every style. Not observed in practice.
- `GhosttyRuntime.defaultFontSize()` read the `f32` `font-size` into a `Double`, so it
  returned 0 and remembered font sizes never went back to "follow the config". Found during
  this work and fixed separately in #863.
