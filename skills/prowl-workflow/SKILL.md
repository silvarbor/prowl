  Author, validate, run, and participate in Prowl Agent Workflows — the `prowl.workflow/v1`
  bundles that orchestrate several live coding agents (launch, message, loop on verdicts,
  collect outputs, run built-in or local script actions) inside the running Prowl app.
  Use it to create, test, or debug a workflow action. Reach for this whenever the user wants a
  workflow created or edited ("write me a Prowl workflow that has two agents review each
  other", "add an input to the guessing-game workflow"), wants one executed ("use Prowl's
  adversarial-review workflow on this branch", "run the count-files workflow", "跑一下
  xxx workflow"), asks about a run's progress or its result files, or when a `[Prowl] …`
  line with a `prowl workflow deliver` command appears in this pane — that means this agent is
  a participant in a run and must deliver through the workflow protocol. Not for driving
  individual panes directly (use prowl-cli) and not for Prowl settings/UI questions.
metadata:
  prowl-summary: Teaches an agent to write, validate, and run Prowl Agent Workflow bundles, to create and test local script actions, to act as a participant when a workflow messages it, and to read a run's logs and output files. Link it into a runtime's skill folder so the agent can build and drive multi-agent workflows on request.

# Prowl Agent Workflows

A workflow is a `.pwlworkflow` directory with `workflow.yaml` (`schema: prowl.workflow/v1`)
and optional local script actions, helpers, schemas, and assets. It declares roles and
sequential steps, typed state, nested conditions and loops. Prowl executes it; agent roles
use real terminal panes. Sources, later shadowing earlier by ID: app bundle (`prowl.*`
reserved), user (`~/.prowl/workflows/*.pwlworkflow`), repo
(`<repo root>/.prowl/workflows/*.pwlworkflow`). Pass bundle directories, not loose YAML files.

Pick the section for the task; load a reference file only when that task is at hand:

| Task | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Write or edit a workflow | read [references/authoring.md](references/authoring.md) first — full DSL, validator rules, patterns, worked example |
| Create or test a script action | [references/actions.md](references/actions.md) — package layout, JSON protocol, approval, result records |
| Start a workflow, inspect or debug a run, decode an error | [Running](#running-a-workflow) below; details in [references/runbook.md](references/runbook.md) |
| A `[Prowl] …` line appeared in this pane | [Participating](#participating-in-a-run) below |

## Authoring loop

Read `references/authoring.md`, draft the requested workflow, validate it with
`prowl workflow validate <bundle.pwlworkflow>`, and fix errors while assessing warnings. `validate` and
`prowl workflow schema` work with Prowl closed. Passing static validation does not guarantee
start-time admission or successful execution: profiles, panes, inputs, CLI connectivity,
and the agents' work still matter. If validation cannot run, disclose that limitation.
Creating a definition does not itself require starting it; run it when that is part of
the user's request.

For launch roles, **omit `agents` unless the user explicitly requires particular runtimes
or the task has a concrete runtime-specific requirement**. Omission allows any qualifying
Agent Profile. Do not invent an allow-list from your own runtime, installed profiles,
example tokens, or assumptions about which model is best. Leave `suggest` unset too unless
it expresses a user-provided preference or a concrete task requirement; let Prowl's profile
picker and saved preferences choose the agent by default.

Examples demonstrate individual capabilities, not a mandatory architecture. Use the roles,
steps, and output contracts the task needs; add loops, deadlines, and automatic pane closure
only when their behavior serves the requested outcome. The authoring reference explains
data dependencies, loop exits, and typed state and result scopes.

## Built-in handoff

Use `prowl workflow run prowl.handoff --role receiver=<Profile> --json` to prepare and save
this conversation's task context, then start and focus a receiver in a new tab. Both modes
require a source pane with a detected agent. Use `--input next=save` instead to
save without a receiver. Follow the returned `self_initiated.line` and deliver the briefing
with its exact command; do not wait for Prowl to message you again. The receiver reads the
saved packet and continues the task. A completed run confirms save/launch, not task completion.

## Built-in Review Loop

Use `prowl workflow run prowl.review-loop --role reviewer=<Profile> --json` from the
implementing agent. Follow the returned `self_initiated.line` to deliver the scope,
plan, and verification brief. The reviewer opens in a right split in the same tab.
Optional inputs: `min_rounds=2`, `max_rounds=4` (each 1–30, minimum must not exceed
maximum), and `focus=<one-line instruction>`. Any qualifying Profile can review.

Prowl handles every round and handoff. Reviewer reports findings; main verifies and
fixes or explains each disposition. Reviewer may run tests. Main owns commits,
pushes, and existing PR updates unless it explicitly delegates them, subject to task
restrictions. Do not dispatch the other role manually. Deliver each assigned step,
then wait for its next task. Do not change reviewed code after your delivery.

Clean exit needs the minimum rounds, a clean reviewer report, and no later changes
or pending follow-up from main. At the maximum, main still addresses findings and
reports remaining issues and fixes not reviewed again. `completed` means the procedure ended; read the final
summary for `clean` versus `not clean`. The reviewer pane stays open.

## Running a workflow

```bash
prowl workflow list [--json]                  # what this worktree can see, with validation status
prowl workflow run <id|name> [source] \
    [--role r=<profile|auto|pN>] [--input k=v] [--skip <step-id>] [--json]
prowl workflow status [run-id] [--json]       # no args inside a run: who am I / what is awaited
prowl workflow cancel <run-id> [--json]
```

- `[source]` is a pane/tab/worktree reference (`pN`, `tN`, UUID, or the worktree name that
  `prowl workflow list` prints as `Worktree: <name>` — `main`, not the `Repo:main` label of
  `prowl list`). Omitted inside a pane: that pane serves the `current` role and its worktree
  is the run's; outside a pane the focused worktree is used, and a workflow with a `current`
  role fails with `SOURCE_REQUIRED`. Required inputs without defaults must be passed via
  `--input k=v`.
- When starting from the `current` role's own pane, inspect the `run` response for
  `self_initiated` (`.data.self_initiated` with `--json`). If present, follow its `line` or
  `prompt_path` and completion command yourself; Prowl does not type that first task
  back into the same pane. Waiting for another message would leave your own step unfinished.
- The run is asynchronous: `run` returns the run id and frozen bindings; poll
  `prowl workflow status <run-id> --json` (`.data.status.state` is `running`,
  `needs_attention`, or a terminal state; `.data.finished_at` appears when it ended) or read
  the run directory (`~/.prowl/logs/workflow-runs/<root-name>-<root-hash>/YYYY-MM/<run-id>/` — `log.md` is the
  timeline; field guide, layout, and error tables in `references/runbook.md`). Finishing never
  closes launched panes; only a `close:` step does.
- The GUI starts (Command Palette, Agents capsule popover, Active Agents context menu) go
  through the same admission — behavior is identical to the CLI. Settings › Agents › Workflows
  lists every bundle with the same validation diagnostics, the enable toggle (a disabled workflow
  is `WORKFLOW_DISABLED` for `run`), and the remembered profile per launch role.

## Participating in a run

An active task delivered by Prowl in this pane, a launched role's kickoff protocol, or a
`self_initiated` task in the run response makes this agent a participant. A message task
looks like this:

```
[Prowl] <prompt or scoped-read command…> — finish with: PROWL_WORKFLOW_TOKEN=<token> prowl workflow deliver [--verdict <v>] -
```

1. Do the work the prompt asks for, completely, before delivering.
2. Deliver by running the **exact rendered command** with the body on stdin as markdown
   (`printf '…' | PROWL_WORKFLOW_TOKEN=… prowl workflow deliver -`). When verdict variants are
   offered, pick exactly one and run that variant.
3. Include the declared sections, format, and verdict. Empty bodies are rejected; other
   contract mismatches are provisional by default or rejected under `strict: true`. Check
   the receipt: **Delivered** means accepted; **Provisional** still needs resolution, even
   when the command exits successfully. Do not report a step completed merely because its
   output file exists. A provisional delivery waits for the user's decision; **Ask again**
   reopens delivery so you can correct it. Do not blindly resubmit or invent a replacement
   token; [runbook](references/runbook.md) explains the states.
4. Lost? `prowl workflow status` (no arguments) answers "who am I": this pane's run, role,
   awaited step, its requirements and completion command.
5. Never use `prowl agents dispatch-complete` for a workflow activation — it is rejected
   with `WORKFLOW_DELIVERY_REQUIRED` naming the correct command.
6. A launched participant finds the same contract in its kickoff prompt ("Prowl workflow
   completion protocol"), with the token already in its environment as
   `PROWL_WORKFLOW_TOKEN`.

This skill ships inside the app: `prowl skills install prowl-workflow` links it into every
detected agent skill folder; `prowl skills list` shows per-target status. `prowl-cli` is
the companion skill for driving individual panes outside a workflow.

## Assigned content and retention

Use the scoped `prowl workflow read` command supplied with the task to retrieve
the prompt. Read returned resource IDs with the same run ID and invocation number;
`workflow-resource:` references are handles, not filesystem paths. Use `--json`
for byte-preserving reads, decode each chunk by its `encoding`, and continue with
`--offset <next_offset>` until `next_offset` is absent. Only the assigned pane can read this content; reads do not require a token.
Deliver ordinary text/JSON on stdin with `prowl workflow deliver -`; no project-local
temporary output file is needed. Explicit delivery is required.

Run artifacts expire with their run: 30 days for unpinned terminal runs, with a
5 GiB soft global budget and a 24-hour diagnostic window. Keep Run prevents automatic
cleanup. Export a terminal run from Execution History for a durable complete ZIP.
