"""Turn a `prowl read --source detection` capture into a corpus fixture.

Implements steps 3, 6, and 7 of the capture-and-promotion procedure in
`supacodeTests/Fixtures/AgentScreenDetection/README.md`: it rejects a capture
that is not detector-faithful, reduces the screen to the exact slice the
detector reads for the given agent, and applies redactions without changing
the visible width of any line.

The reduction mirrors `DetectedAgent.detectionScreenText(from:)`: `claude`
consumes the full active screen and is passed through untrimmed, `pi` consumes a
32-line tail, and every other agent consumes a 24-line tail. `--agent` selects
among the three, and is required because the capture does not record which
detector will consume it.

Width matters. A fixture exists to pin how the classifier reads a real screen,
and the agent CLIs wrap, shorten, and truncate their rows to the terminal width.
A redaction that lengthens or shortens a line moves a wrap point and turns the
fixture into a screen the product would never render, so every substitution here
either preserves the line's visible width or is refused.

Usage:

    scripts/make-detection-fixture.py capture.json \\
        --agent claude \\
        --redact /Users/me=/Users/usr \\
        --redact 'Acme Inc=<ORG_0000>' \\
        > supacodeTests/Fixtures/AgentScreenDetection/claude/2.1.226/idle/composer.txt

Each `--redact OLD=NEW` is applied in order. `NEW` may differ in length from
`OLD`: the difference is taken out of, or added to, that line's trailing spaces,
which are invisible on screen. A line with too little trailing slack to absorb a
longer replacement is reported and the run fails, rather than silently shifting
the row.

The redaction summary the metadata file requires (README step 5) is written to
stderr, so it does not contaminate the fixture on stdout. It reports each
replacement and how many lines it touched, and never the text that was
replaced: that summary is committed, and the original is what the redaction
existed to keep out of the repository.
