# Remote Mirror (experimental)

Two Prowl apps can view and control the same Host terminal. The Host keyboard stays
available. Each pane has one remote owner. Explicit **Take Over** replaces that
owner; **Retry** and foreground recovery only reconnect when the pane is free.
Ordinary **Mirror** on a pane listed as free does not take over a client that acquired
it after the list was read; use the explicit **Take Over** action.

## Enable and pair

Launch the Mac App with `PROWL_REMOTE_MIRROR=1`. The experiment is hidden and cannot
start a listener otherwise. Hover over the **Remote Mirror** network button to
preview, or click to keep it open. Under **Host**, pick **Listen on** and a port,
then **Start Host**. The picker offers all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`), each of this
Mac's IPv4 interfaces by name, and this Mac only (`127.0.0.1`); a value saved
from an earlier version appears as **Custom**. The icon is gray when stopped,
muted blue when listening, and muted green when at least one pane is mirrored.
A listener is reachable from the local network or a VPN; the internet cannot reach
it unless a router forwards the port. Without a paired device key or a live pairing
code, a connection fails during the TLS handshake.

**Add a Device** opens a modal pairing sheet. It lists the addresses a Client can
enter (the Bonjour name and each interface reachable through the current listen
setting, each with the port and a copy button), then a large 60-second code with a
copy button (⌘C). If the listener is restarting, the sheet waits before generating
its first code; if Host is off, the sheet offers **Start Host**. **Refresh Code**
replaces the code; **Cancel** invalidates an unused code without stopping Host or
revoking a device that already paired. When a device completes pairing, the sheet
shows **Paired with** its name and closes by itself. On the other Mac, open
**Remote Mirror → Client → Connect to a New Host** and enter the address (an IP or a
host name such as `mini.local`), port, and code. On iOS, use the connection editor.
Successful enrollment consumes the code. The client saves its device credential in
Keychain, then opens a new authenticated connection. A pairing-only connection
cannot list or operate panes. No extra long-lived code is required. A saved
enrollment remains available for Retry if the first runtime connection fails.

On Mac, paired Hosts are listed under **Client** with their name and last
connection time. This list holds addresses only, stored outside Keychain, so hover
previews show it without reading credentials. Records written by an earlier
version are imported from Keychain once, after the first click on the Remote
Mirror button; if that import fails, a hint keeps **Connect to a New Host**
available and **Try Again** repeats it. Click **Connect** beside a Host to
authenticate and open the pane picker without entering the address or code again.
The **…** menu offers **Rename…**, a name shown on this Mac only, and **Forget**,
which removes the saved access. Saved entries do not imply that the Host is
online; connection failures appear in the connection sheet. In the connection
form the code field appears only when this Mac has no saved access for the
address. If the Host no longer recognizes this Mac, for example after **Revoke**,
the attempt fails at once with an explanation and the code field appears. A
refused port, an unreachable address, or an unresolved name also fails at once;
an unanswered connection gives up after ten seconds. Saved credentials survive
Host stop/start and App restart. They do not discover a changed IP address. The iOS
connection editor can retain a device credential while updating the Host address;
the client checks the Host identity after connecting. A new Host or revoked device
requires a fresh pairing window. Old experiment keys are not migrated.

The Host section lists paired devices with **Connected** and the active mirror
count, **Last seen** for a device that is offline, or **Paired · never connected**,
plus mirrored pane names and **Revoke**, which asks for confirmation. Each active
mirror has a green dot and a red disconnect button. **Disconnect** asks for
confirmation, then disconnects only that mirror. The terminal keeps running,
other mirrors remain connected, and the device stays paired and can reconnect.
If that connection has already ended or been replaced, confirmation does nothing. A device
browsing panes can be connected with zero mirrors.
Device labels use the Mac local host name or the iOS system device name; pairing
does not resolve a DNS name to obtain this label.

Revocation removes the persisted secret and disconnects all connections for that device;
other devices remain connected. Device records are limited to 64. If enrollment
succeeds on Host but its response or the client's save is lost, open a new window
and remove the unused device record. Unreadable saved entries are omitted from the Host list without deleting them.
Errors that prevent pairing or connection remain visible in plain language, naming
the address and the reason; a port already in use or an address this Mac does not
have stops Host with the same kind of message. Keychain
status codes are logged for diagnosis. Credentials are never stored as plaintext.

The pairing window changes the listener's TLS keys. Prowl waits for the old
listener's cancellation before rebinding its port; established connections survive.
Pairing success is sent only after the replacement listener can accept the new device credential.
Stopping Host closes remote connections but leaves Host programs running. Closing a
mirror only unsubscribes. Quitting Prowl does not promise that its programs survive.

## Panes, display and history

The Client sidebar lets you select a mirror by clicking anywhere in its row.
The native window toolbar places the pane title and subtitle after the Remote
Mirror button. The center shows connection status and the Host address; hover for
the full pane name, directory, and Host endpoint. On the right, the display-size
toggle switches between **Fit to Window** and **Original Size** with one click;
its icon shows the current mode. **History** opens retained text, and the red
disconnect icon closes that mirror without stopping the Host program.
**Retry** or **Take Over** stays visible when needed, and **Live Terminal** returns
from history to the live view.

Choose an existing pane or use **New Pane…** on Mac. Existing panes use their
terminal and worktree names without generated Tab N labels. The whole pane row
is clickable; **Refresh Panes** and **Cancel** share the bottom action row.
A project that has never opened a terminal is not yet a pane, but its worktree is
available in **New Pane…** on a current Host. The Host terminal owns the
grid. Mac clients default to **Fit to Window**, shrinking the complete terminal to
fit without changing the Host PTY. **Original Size** restores readable native-size
glyphs with local scrolling. It starts at the top; subsequent window resizes preserve
the manual scroll position within the available bounds. Large Host grids can make
Fit to Window text small. iOS
renders replacement text with local reflow. Cleared output is not an archive.

Host samples subscribed panes every 200 ms and allows only one unacknowledged frame
per subscription. Unchanged frames are omitted; text geometry and truncation are
also part of the change check. No subscriptions means no terminal sampling.

**History** pages one frozen retained-text snapshot, 200 lines at a time, with a
2 MiB UTF-8 budget. Refresh starts a new snapshot. Graphics, link targets and cursor
shape are not guaranteed by the formatter. Disconnected output remains visible,
with input disabled and a reason/retry action.

## Create from Mac

After connecting, **New Pane…** lists Host worktrees, including worktrees with no
open terminal. Choose **Shell** or **Agent Profile**; a Profile may include an
optional initial prompt. **Create and Mirror** creates one background tab through
the public CLI router and opens its mirror. The Host selection and focus stay put.
The display uses Host Profile availability; unavailable Profiles cannot launch.
An older Host that only advertises Profile creation does not offer Shell.

**Back** returns to existing panes. If creation cannot be confirmed, the form keeps
its values and blocks another creation; inspect the pane list before starting a
new connection to try again. No creation is replayed automatically after a timeout,
cancellation, or disconnect. Closing a mirror still leaves the Host program running.

## Create and send from iOS

**New Agent Pane** selects an existing Host worktree and an available Agent Profile,
with an optional initial prompt. Host creates a normal background tab through its
public CLI router. There is no special AI Control Console, bundled private control
skill, or separate agent-launch implementation. Profile settings determine model
and permissions.

Every Send first reads public `list`. A detected Agent uses public `agents dispatch`.
Host rechecks the exact subscribed pane and lease, plus input protection, before delivery.
Mobile shell panes are read-only: Host cannot yet verify an empty shell command line,
so structured shell Send is refused and its capability is not advertised. An idle task
can still contain an older local draft. Use an Agent Profile for mobile prompts, or
control the shell on Host. Local CLI `send` and Mac mirror keyboard input retain their
existing direct-input behavior.

Shared Agent dispatch rejects IME composition and recent Host editing. Claude must
have a recognized empty composer. It inserts text, waits up to two seconds for the
paste echo, and only then sends Enter, provided the surface/Agent/edit revision is
unchanged. Codex has an explicit idle-composer rule; the delivery boundary also
checks formatter dim styling so a hint is not confused with an identically worded
draft. Unknown layouts, wrapped drafts and attachments refuse delivery.

A successful dispatch receipt confirms delivery, not Agent completion. Replies are
correlated by UUID. Unknown delivery preserves the draft and is not automatically
replayed; reconnection queries the original request receipt on the same Host run.
If delivery stops after paste but before Enter, text may remain in the Host composer;
check it before retrying.

Host retains up to 1024 mutation receipts per App lifetime, and rejects further mutations
when full. Catalog reads do not consume this budget. A retained mutation ID reused with
different parameters is rejected. Takeover/disconnect cancels a dispatch still waiting for readiness. Explicit device revocation or Host stop
also cancels pending Profile preparation, including requests whose connection was
already lost. A plain disconnect alone does not cancel accepted Profile creation;
check Host before retrying an uncertain result. Existing terminal programs continue.

## Protocol and development

See [wire contract](remote-mirror-wire.md). This replaces the earlier experimental
protocol: upgrade both ends together. There is no version negotiation, legacy
64-character key, private `submit/state` protocol, or copied mobile Host fixture.
Mac Host behavior is tested in the real App target; iOS tests its client plus a
native TLS transport and the same fixed wire vectors.

Mac replicas use the separately bundled `prowl-mirror-relay`. Its loopback protocol
is distinct: kind:u8, length:u32 big-endian, payload. A private per-replica token
protects input forwarding. The helper exits on socket/stdin EOF and never launches
a remote program. `make embed-cli-debug` builds/embeds both CLI and helper;
`scripts/test-remote-mirror.sh` runs the App-target mirror tests.

The Ghostty bridge from `onevcat/ghostty` PR #2, with keyboard-mode and styled-blank-cell
export fixes, is pinned at `5afdc9cf7315`.
The default build downloads the matching XCFramework and resources, verified against
`scripts/ghosttykit-checksums.txt`. No sibling Ghostty checkout is required.
Real Agent and cross-device acceptance remain separate from component/socket test evidence.

## Mobile client projects

Native clients live in [MirrorClient/iOS](../MirrorClient/iOS/) (iPhone and iPad)
and [MirrorClient/Android](../MirrorClient/Android/) (phones and tablets). Each
project retains its own build and test entry points; neither is built by the Mac
App target or release pipeline. See [client setup](../MirrorClient/README.md).
