# Repositories & Git Worktrees

> The sidebar and everything in it: adding projects, and creating, opening,
> archiving, and deleting git worktrees — the unit of work you hand to an agent.

## What it is

The left **sidebar** lists your **repositories**, each expandable into its
**worktrees**. A repository is a git project (or a plain non-git folder) you've
added. A worktree is one branch checked out into its own directory, so multiple
branches are live on disk at once — ideal for giving each agent its own branch.

Within a repository, worktrees are grouped: **Main** (the repo root), **Pinned**,
**Pending** (being created), and the rest. Each row shows the name, branch detail,
an unread-notification bell, and run/agent status.

## Repository kinds

| Kind | Worktrees | Branches | Diff | PRs | Run scripts |
|------|-----------|----------|------|-----|-------------|
| **git** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **plain** (non-git folder) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

A plain folder can't expand; clicking it just opens a terminal there. Prowl
auto-detects which kind a path is when you add it (it runs `git` to find the repo
root; "not a git repository" → plain folder). If you later run `git init` in an
open plain folder, Prowl automatically upgrades it to a git repository and
refreshes the sidebar.

## Adding a repository

- **Shortcut:** `⌘⇧O` (`open_repository`)
- **Toolbar:** the **Add...** button (folder-with-plus icon) at the top of the
  sidebar. Use the popover to browse for a local folder, drag a folder onto the
  drop zone, clone a remote git URL into a chosen directory, or start workspace
  creation.
- **Command Palette:** "Open Repository".

Pick one or more directories. Prowl detects git vs plain, de-duplicates, and
persists the list. Paths that don't exist or can't be read are reported in an
alert after the load. Repositories added after the initial app load are selected
automatically. If a repository was added through a symbolic link, Prowl resolves
and stores its actual git root so branches and worktrees continue to load.

## Creating a worktree

- **Shortcut:** `⌘N` (`new_worktree`)
- **Button:** the **+** on a repository's header (only for git repos that support
  worktrees).
- **Context menu:** right-click a repository header → "New Worktree".
- **Command Palette:** "New Worktree".

By default a **creation prompt** appears (controlled by
`promptForWorktreeCreation`) where you:
- enter a **branch name** (leave blank to auto-generate, e.g. `bold-cat-523`).
  On devices with Apple Intelligence, an on-device AI suggestion may appear below
  the field based on your repository context and recent terminal activity — click
  **Use** to adopt it,
- choose the **base ref** (branch/tag) to branch from,
- optionally **fetch the remote first**.

An optional, default-collapsed **Advanced** section lets you override where the
worktree lands:
- **Worktree name** — the leaf folder name (defaults to the branch name).
- **Parent folder** — the directory it's created in (defaults to the repo's
  resolved base directory).

Leave both blank to keep the default `base/<branch>` placement. The footer shows
the full destination path as you type, or an inline error (the worktree name is a
single folder, so slashes, `.`/`..`, and `.git` are rejected).

Press **↩** to create, **Esc** to cancel. Branch names are validated live
(`git check-ref-format`).

**Creation runs through the bundled `wt` CLI** (`Resources/git-wt`) and streams
progress through stages: reading local branches → choosing a name → checking repo
mode → resolving the base ref → fetching → creating. A **Pending** row shows the
live status until it's ready.

**Copying uncommitted files:** new worktrees can optionally copy `.gitignore`'d
files (`copyIgnoredOnWorktreeCreate`) and/or untracked files
(`copyUntrackedOnWorktreeCreate`) from the source — set globally or per repo.

**Setup script:** if the repo defines a setup script, it runs automatically in the
new worktree (see [custom-actions](custom-actions.md)).

## Selecting & switching worktrees

- **Click** a row to select it (focuses its terminal).
- **`⌃1`–`⌃9`** jump to worktree 1–9.
- **`⌘⌃↓` / `⌘⌃↑`** select next / previous worktree.
- **`⌘⌥[` / `⌘⌥]`** go back / forward through worktree selection history.
- **`⌘⇧L`** reveals the currently focused worktree in the sidebar.

## Pinning & ordering

- **Pin / Unpin:** hover a worktree → pin button, or right-click → "Pin to top" /
  "Unpin". Pinned worktrees sit in a section above the rest. (Not available for
  the main worktree.)
- **Reorder:** drag repositories or worktrees to rearrange; a thin accent line
  shows the drop target. Order is persisted.
- **Expand / Collapse:** click the chevron on a repo header, or cycle the
  sidebar's header button: from all-collapsed it offers **Expand Active**
  (double chevron `»` — expands only repos/workspaces that have open terminal
  tabs), then **Expand All** (single chevron `›`), then **Collapse All**
  (chevron rotated down). Expand Active is skipped when no repo (or every
  repo) has open tabs. Collapsed state is remembered.
- **Tab count badges:** a collapsed repo header shows its total open-tab count;
  expanding a git repo moves the count onto the individual worktree rows
  (hidden at zero). Workspaces and plain folders always show the count on the
  header.

## Archiving a worktree

Archiving hides a worktree from the main list without deleting it.

- **Right-click** the row → "Archive Worktree" (or "Archive Selected Worktrees"
  with a multi-selection). No default keyboard shortcut.
- If the branch is already **merged**, Prowl archives immediately without asking.
- If the repo defines an **archive script**, it runs first (live progress); if it
  fails, archiving stops and the worktree stays active.
- **View archived:** `⌘⌃A` toggles the Archived Worktrees panel (press again to
  return to the previous worktree), grouped by repo, with **Unarchive** and
  **Delete Selected** (`⌘⇧⌫`) buttons.
- **Auto-delete:** if `archivedAutoDeletePeriod` is set, archived worktrees older
  than the period are deleted automatically.

The **main worktree cannot be archived.**

## Deleting a worktree

Deleting removes the worktree directory (and optionally its branch).

- **Right-click** the row → "Delete Worktree", or **`⌘⇧⌫`**.
- A confirmation dialog offers an **"Also delete local branch"** toggle (its
  tooltip notes `git branch -d`). The toggle remembers the last confirmed choice
  (`deleteBranchOnManualWorktreeDelete` in UserDefaults; defaults to off).
- Prowl removes the worktree (relocating + `git worktree prune` if needed), then
  verifies that Git no longer registers it. Cleanup failures keep the worktree
  visible and show Git's error. If branch deletion is rejected because the branch
  isn't merged, Prowl offers a **force delete** (`git branch -D`).
- Protected branches (`main`, `master`, and the detected default) are guarded.

The **main worktree cannot be deleted.**

## Removing a repository

Right-click a repo header → "Remove Repository" (or the **⋯** menu). This removes
it from Prowl (closing its open terminals); it does **not** delete files on disk.

## Opening a worktree in another app

`⌘O` opens the worktree with the selected open action. When the action is
**Automatic** (the default), Prowl inspects the worktree's top-level files and
prefers an app matching the project type: Flutter (`pubspec.yaml` with a
`flutter:` key) → Android Studio (then IntelliJ, then the VS Code family),
React Native (`package.json` depending on `react-native` plus an `ios/` or
`android/` folder) → VS Code family (then WebStorm, then Android Studio),
Unity (`ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt` at the root or one folder down,
covering SDK repos that keep the Unity project beside tooling manifests) →
Rider (then the VS Code family),
`.xcodeproj`/`.xcworkspace`/
`Package.swift`/`Project.swift` → Xcode, Gradle files → Android Studio (then
IntelliJ IDEA, then IDEA EAP), `*.sln`/`*.csproj` → Rider, `pom.xml` →
IntelliJ IDEA (then IDEA EAP), `go.mod` → GoLand, `Cargo.toml` → RustRover,
`CMakeLists.txt` → CLion, `composer.json` → PhpStorm, `Gemfile` → RubyMine,
Python manifests → PyCharm, `package.json` → WebStorm. If the matching app
isn't installed (or no project type is detected), it falls back to the generic
priority — your first installed editor (Cursor → Zed → Zed Preview →
VS Code → Windsurf → …), falling through to Xcode and then **Finder only when
no preferred app is found**. Use the **Open** dropdown in the worktree's
detail toolbar to pick a different app (this pins it for the repo), or pick
**Automatic** at the top of that dropdown to clear the pin and return to
project-aware selection. You can also set a per-repo default (`openActionID`)
/ global default (`defaultEditorID`). Prowl detects: Finder, Terminal,
`$EDITOR`, VS Code (+ Insiders), VSCodium, Cursor, Zed (+ Preview), Windsurf,
Antigravity, Sublime Text, Nova, Xcode, Android Studio, JetBrains IDEs
(IntelliJ IDEA and IDEA EAP, WebStorm, PyCharm, RustRover, Rider, GoLand,
CLion, PhpStorm, RubyMine), GitHub Desktop
/ Fork / Tower / GitKraken / Sourcetree / Sublime Merge / SmartGit / GitUp,
and terminals (Alacritty, Ghostty, iTerm2, Kitty, Warp, WezTerm). If the
chosen app isn't installed, Prowl shows an alert.

Other per-row context-menu items: **Rename Branch…** (`⌘⇧M`; the context menu
targets that row, while the shortcut targets the selected worktree or focused
Canvas card and is unavailable during bulk selection, worktree creation, or
another modal prompt), **New Terminal Tab** (selects the worktree and opens a
tab at the worktree **root** — unlike a plain
new tab, it never inherits the focused tab's current directory), **Stop Running
Script** (only while a Prowl-tracked run script is running), **Copy Path**,
**Copy Branch Name**,
**Reveal in Finder**, **Open Pull Request** (only when the worktree has a PR),
and **Close All Tabs** (disabled when the worktree has no tabs; uses the same
active-agent / long-running-command confirmation as the tab bar's "Close All",
and the confirmation names the target worktree).

The repository **header** menu (right-click, or the **⋯** button) offers
**New Worktree** (git repos only), **Repo Settings…**, and
**Remove Repository**. Plain folders and workspaces get **Copy Path** /
**Reveal in Finder** instead of New Worktree; git repo headers deliberately have
no path actions because a repository's root can be a bare directory — use the
worktree rows for paths.

## Repository appearance (icon & color)

In **Repo Settings** you can give each repository an **icon** (any SF Symbol from
a curated set, a bundled asset, or your own image) and a **color** (10 presets or
a custom color). The color tints the icon, the name, the Shelf spine (if
`shelfSpineTintFollowsRepositoryColor`), and the window chrome (if
`windowTintMode = repositoryColor`). You can also set a **custom display title**
(`customTitle`) that overrides the folder name.

**Automatic icon detection** (`detectRepositoryIconsAutomatically`, default on):
when a repository or folder is newly added, Prowl scans it locally in the
background for a high-confidence product icon — an Icon Composer `.icon`
bundle (flattened via QuickLook) or `AppIcon.appiconset` raster for Apple
projects, an Android launcher raster, the iOS/Android assets of a Flutter or
React Native project, Tauri bundle icons from `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, a
`package.json` `"icon"` declaration, or a web manifest icon / `rel=icon`
favicon / root logo for web projects — and silently sets it as the repo icon.
For any other repository, a last generic tier accepts a near-square
`icon`/`logo`/`appicon` image (`svg`/`png`/`webp`) at the root, `assets/`, or
`.github/`; wide wordmark logos and banners are rejected by an aspect-ratio
gate. Detection never runs for existing repositories, workspaces, or repos
that already have an icon, and it never replaces a manual choice. **Clear Icon** removes a
detected icon and suppresses re-detection; only removing and re-adding the
repository triggers a fresh scan. Detected icons keep their original colors
(they are never tinted, unlike user-picked SVGs/symbols).

**Suggest an Icon…** (Repository Icon menu): generates SF Symbol suggestions
for the repository on-device from its README (falling back to the package
manifest description, then the repo name). The picker sheet opens immediately
with an inline loading state; results show the best pick plus four
alternates, a reasoning line, and the input source. When Apple Intelligence
is unavailable the results are labeled **Keyword suggestions**. Nothing is
applied until you pick a symbol and confirm. Results are cached in memory for
the session; **Regenerate** runs a fresh pass.

## Lifecycle states (what the row can show)

- **Pending** — worktree is being created (grey row, live stage text).
- **Creating / Archiving / Removing** — transient loading states with progress.
- **Running** — a Run Script or agent task is active in that worktree.
- **Unread bell** — the worktree has unseen notifications.

## Settings that affect this area

Global (Settings → Worktree / General) and per-repository (Repo Settings) — see
[`reference/settings-fields.md`](../reference/settings-fields.md) for the full
list. Highlights:

- `promptForWorktreeCreation`, `fetchOriginBeforeWorktreeCreation`
- `defaultWorktreeBaseDirectoryPath` / per-repo `worktreeBaseDirectoryPath`
- per-repo `worktreeBaseRef` (default base branch)
- `copyIgnoredOnWorktreeCreate`, `copyUntrackedOnWorktreeCreate`
- `deleteBranchOnAutomaticCleanup`, `mergedWorktreeAction`, `archivedAutoDeletePeriod`
- per-repo `setupScript`, `archiveScript`, `openActionID`, `customTitle`

## Gotchas for agents

- The **main worktree** (`isMain`) is special: no archive/delete/rename.
- Worktree **names are auto-generated** (`adjective-animal-number`) unless the user
  named them — don't assume the name reflects the branch's purpose.
- Removing a repository does **not** delete files; deleting a worktree **does**
  remove its directory (and optionally its branch).
- A worktree's `id` is its **path** (with trailing-slash normalization) — the same
  identifier the [`prowl` CLI](cli.md) uses.
