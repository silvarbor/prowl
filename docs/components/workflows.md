# Agent Workflows

> Workflow UI is enabled by default. Start Prowl with `PROWL_WORKFLOW_UI=0` to hide its UI and skill row; CLI workflow and skill commands remain available. The switch is read at process startup.

> Multi-step, multi-agent orchestrations that Prowl runs and supervises for
> you: a workflow bundle declares the roles (the pane you start from, an agent Prowl
> launches, an agent you pick) and the steps (message a role, launch one, loop
> until a verdict, notify, close); Prowl types the instructions into the right
> panes, waits for each delivery, and shows the run in the toolbar. This page
> covers the feature end to end — files, entry points, the start sheet, the run
> panel, and Settings → Agents → Workflows. For the CLI commands and their JSON,
> see [`cli.md`](cli.md#prowl-workflow); to write or debug a workflow, an agent
> should load the bundled `prowl-workflow` skill.

## What it is

A workflow bundle scripts several live agents: who takes part and what happens in
order. Prowl executes it — every participant is a real terminal pane you can
watch — and agents take part only through the `prowl` CLI, so any runtime Prowl
recognizes can play any role. A typical workflow: the pane you are working in
writes a brief, Prowl launches a reviewer beside it from an Agent Profile, the
reviewer reports findings with a verdict, and the two loop until the verdict is
`clean` or the round cap is hit.

A `.pwlworkflow` directory contains `workflow.yaml` with `schema: prowl.workflow/v1`,
and optional local script actions and assets. Workflow definitions are loaded from bundle directories. Roles have a `source`:

| `source` | Meaning | How it is chosen |
|---|---|---|
| `current` | the pane the run was started from | the pane you start from (or pick in the sheet) |
| `launch` | a new agent Prowl starts from an [Agent Profile](agent-profiles.md) | remembered profile → profile matching the role's `suggest` → the repository's Recommended profile → the sheet asks |
| `pick` | an existing detected agent pane in the same worktree | always chosen at start |

For a `launch` role, omit `agents` by default to allow any qualifying Agent Profile.
Only add a runtime allow-list for an explicit user requirement or a concrete runtime-specific
capability. `agents: []` allows none; `any` and `*` are not wildcard tokens. Leave `suggest`
unset unless there is a specific preference to express; profile selection normally belongs
to the user's saved preferences and the start-sheet picker.

Steps are `message` (send a prompt to an idle role), `launch` (start a launch role with a kickoff prompt),
`set`, nested `if`/`else`, `while`, `break`/`continue`,
`action` (built-in or local script), `notify`, and `close`. A `message` or
`launch` step may `expect` an output: the role finishes by running the exact
`prowl workflow deliver …` command Prowl typed into its pane, with the body on
stdin. The full DSL, validator rules, and authoring patterns are the
`prowl-workflow` skill's job (`prowl skills install prowl-workflow`);
`prowl workflow schema` prints the workflow JSON Schema; `prowl workflow schema --action` prints the action manifest schema.

## Where workflow files live

Three sources, later ones winning for the same `id`:

| Source | Location | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Built-in | `Prowl.app/Contents/Resources/workflows/` | ids `prowl.*` are reserved for it. Ships Handoff (`prowl.handoff`) and Review Loop (`prowl.review-loop`). |
| Your workflows | `~/.prowl/workflows/*.pwlworkflow` | personal; not tied to a repository |
| Repository | `<repo root>/.prowl/workflows/*.pwlworkflow` | travels with the repo; seen only from that repository's worktrees |

A file that fails validation is never offered for a run; a file with the same
id in two sources is offered once (the repository file wins over yours). A
workflow is **enabled by default**; switch it off in Settings (below) to hide it
from every entry point and refuse `prowl workflow run` for it.

## Built-in Review Loop

**Review Loop** (`prowl.review-loop`) reviews changes with another agent, addresses
findings, and repeats. Start it from the agent that implemented the task:

```bash
prowl workflow run prowl.review-loop --role reviewer="Pi Reviewer" \
  --input min_rounds=2 --input max_rounds=4 --json
```

The reviewer Profile is selectable; no model or runtime is required. Prowl opens it
in a right split beside the initiating agent, in the same tab, and reuses it across
rounds. The initiating agent follows the returned `self_initiated.line` to deliver
its scope, plan, and verification brief. Local changes and existing PRs are both
supported. `focus` adds an optional single-line review instruction.

Each round includes a reviewer report and main's disposition. Review focuses on
material correctness, plan gaps, architecture, and realistic UX regressions. Every
report records which files or areas the reviewer inspected. From round 2 on, the
reviewer both re-verifies carried-over findings against main's disposition and
performs a fresh review of the current diff, including code added by fixes and areas
earlier rounds did not inspect; new findings get new IDs. Main
verifies findings, fixes worthwhile problems with regression tests where practical,
and explains rejected or deferred findings. Main owns commits, pushes, and existing
PR updates unless it explicitly delegates them; task restrictions still apply.
The reviewer may run useful tests and otherwise leaves shared files unchanged.
The workflow does not create a PR merely because it ran.

`min_rounds` defaults to **2**, and `max_rounds` to **4** (each accepts 1–30).
A contradictory range requests attention before reviewer launch; cancel and restart
with corrected inputs. An early clean report still receives the required minimum
rounds. Early exit requires both a clean reviewer report and no subsequent in-scope
changes or pending follow-up from main. At the maximum, main still addresses the
final findings, then summarizes unresolved issues and final fixes that have not been reviewed again.

A **Completed** run means the review procedure finished, not necessarily that the
changes are clean. The final notification and summary state `clean` or `not clean`.
Execution history retains the brief, reports, dispositions, and summary under the
normal retention policy. The reviewer pane stays open. Neither agent should send
its own dispatch messages or extend the loop beyond the configured maximum.

## Starting a workflow

Every start — GUI or CLI — goes through the same admission, so behavior is
identical:

- **Command Palette** (`⌘P`) → **Run Workflow: <name>** — one row per
  runnable workflow visible to the selected worktree.
  → [command-palette](command-palette.md)
- **Toolbar Agents capsule** → the **Run a workflow** section — each row uses the
  workflow's YAML icon and starts the workflow. Its trailing `ellipsis.circle`
  menu offers **Run with Options…** (which forces the start sheet) and **Show
  Details in Settings…**. Files that fail validation remain dimmed with their
  reason and still link to their Settings detail. **Manage Workflows…** opens
  Settings → Agents → Workflows, even when no workflows are listed. → [agent-profiles](agent-profiles.md#launching)
- **Active Agents** → right-click a row → **Run Workflow ▸** — starts it with
  that pane fixed as the `current` role's source. → [active-agents](active-agents.md)
- **CLI** — `prowl workflow run <id|name> [source] [--role r=…] [--input k=v] [--skip step]`.
  → [cli](cli.md#prowl-workflow)

### The start sheet

The sheet explains the workflow and collects what the run needs before it exists.
Its header shows the workflow's icon, name, description, and the target worktree;
the body is arranged in sections like the Workflow History panel:

- **Roles** — one label/control row per role, laid out like a Settings form:
  the role's name on the left with a small icon for the kind of pane that serves
  it (terminal = the pane you start from, plus = an agent Prowl launches, person
  = an existing agent), the choice on the right. Hovering the name shows the
  details: the kind of pane, the steps that address the role
  (`Step 1 · Prepare handoff briefing`), and where a launched pane opens. The
  control is the choice for that role:
  - `current` — a pane picker pre-selected from the worktree's focused pane
    (fixed when started from an Active Agents row); a bare shell qualifies only
    while no step messages that role.
  - `launch` — a profile picker pre-selected by binding resolution, filtered to
    profiles that qualify (`agents` allow-list, prompt support); profiles that
    do not qualify are dimmed with the reason. **Create profile from
    suggestion…** appears when the role's `suggest` matches no enabled profile:
    it creates a normal Agent Profile inline and selects it. A launch role the
    current options never reach (a branch that is not taken) is listed dimmed
    with **Not used** in place of its picker. If no profile qualifies, the sheet
    points to the role's agent requirements and Settings → Agents → Profiles.
    Correct the requirements or profiles, then reopen the setup.
  - `pick` — a pane picker over detected agents in the worktree, excluding
    panes already in a run and the source pane.
- **Options** — the declared inputs in the same grid, labeled by their `prompt`
  (hover for the input name and default) with defaults pre-filled; enum inputs
  are menus, the rest text fields. An enum without a default starts at **Choose…**.
  Required inputs without a default must be
  filled before Run enables.
- **Steps** — the run's steps in order with their role, so choices like
  "launch or save" read as "step 3 starts the receiving agent". Steps inside an
  `if` carry a branch icon, steps inside a `while` a repeat icon; hover a step
  for what it does.
- **Optional Steps** — a **Skip <step>** toggle for each step whose output
  nothing later depends on. A skip that would end the run early is refused by
  admission and therefore not offered.
- **Don't ask again** (footer) — writes **Run Directly When Possible** (the same
  choice shown under Settings → Workflows → Run Setup), so the next start skips
  the sheet when nothing is undecided.
- A banner blocks Run when the `prowl` CLI is not usable or when Prowl is not
  listening on its socket (participants could not deliver). Inline action per
  state: **Install** when missing, **Repair** for a dangling link, **Reinstall**
  for a foreign link that is not executable; a real file or folder in the slot
  gets no button, only the instruction to remove it (same matrix as the
  Workflows page banner below). A socket failure shows its reason.

A workflow with `bind: auto` roles, resolved bindings, no `pick` roles, and
fully defaulted inputs starts **without the sheet**; the toolbar status item is
the feedback.

## While a run is active

- The toolbar's center **status item** shows the selected worktree's active run:
  the current step, an orange attention glyph when the run waits for you, and a
  count when several runs share the worktree. Hover previews the run panel;
  click pins it. When a run ends, the item stays for about eight seconds with
  the outcome — a green checkmark and **<workflow> completed**, or the reason it
  stopped — and hovering it opens that run in Workflow History. No separate toast
  is shown; the notification pipeline still delivers the completion notice.
- The **run panel** opens the same step details as Workflow History. Expand a step
  to inspect its output, error, and attempts. Role buttons focus available panes;
  the footer provides the run folder, log, and **Cancel Run**.
- **Needs attention** is a state, not a deadline: a late delivery is still
  accepted. The panel offers exactly the recoveries the runner permits — Focus
  Pane, Nudge Again, Keep Waiting, Retry, Relaunch Role, Accept as Delivered,
  Accept with a declared verdict, Ask Again, Skip Step, Cancel Run.
- Waiting is state-driven: a working agent is never interrupted; an agent whose
  turn ended without delivering gets one typed nudge with the completion command.
- Completion and attention go through the bell with click-to-open run details
  (quiet while you are already watching that worktree). → [notifications](notifications.md)
- Active Agents rows bound to a run show `in <workflow> · <role>` for the life
  of the run; a pane belongs to at most one run at a time.
- Finishing or cancelling never closes a pane; only an explicit `close:` step does.

## Inspect workflow steps after execution

**Workflow History**, beside the toolbar bell, stays available after a run ends.
Hover to preview; click or interact with its contents to keep it open. The default
**This Pane** scope includes runs started from this pane and runs in which it or
its identified agent session participated as a role. **This Worktree** and **All
Runs** include broader history and records whose pane identity is unavailable.

The muted checklist button opens Workflow History. The run list shows each name,
a tinted state icon, and project or pane attribution; completed runs use a green
checkmark. The detail header puts status beside the title and start time beside
elapsed time.

Select a run on the left, then click anywhere on a step row to expand it. Hover
highlights the row. Recorded step duration appears at the right; a dash means no
duration was saved. Checkmarks indicate completed execution; a delivery verdict
such as `issues` does not mean execution failed. Branches not selected, skipped steps, and steps not reached before
termination have separate states. Nested rounds show their complete loop path.
Rounds and retry attempts retain their own
recorded outputs and errors. Provisional and corrected submissions keep separate
body snapshots. Failed action attempts link to their own stdout, stderr, and
execution record. Step titles come from the execution, not from later YAML edits.

Message and launch steps show the target role, recorded profile or agent, and the
saved prompt. A launch reports **Agent started** only after startup succeeds;
without `expect`, this does not mean the agent finished its task. Targets are recorded
per attempt, so a relaunch cannot change an earlier attempt's identity.

Action steps show their action ID and resolved **Input** from that execution's saved
request, separate from **Output**. Conditions show the selected branch and recorded
boolean result. Notifications show the text sent to Prowl Notifications; a declared
step title takes precedence over the default notification label. Pure operations do
not show an empty Output section.

Prompt and delivery previews show the first 200 characters with inline Markdown
formatting and the remaining character count. JSON output uses nested, expandable fields, with single-line values and
middle-truncated paths. Each level shows at most 32 fields, up to five levels deep;
the complete JSON remains available externally. `output` is the action's returned
JSON value; `output_path` is the saved `result.json` file containing that value,
not a second result.

Preview and Copy read files up to 64 MiB. Open and Reveal remain available if a
preview is unavailable or a file exceeds that reader bound.

Compact icon buttons open full output, copy full content, or reveal files in Finder;
hover a button for its label. Named absolute path fields also offer file actions.
Opening is limited to retained workflow storage and the worktree's `.prowl/handoff/`
artifacts, with link and containment checks. **Diagnostics** holds action stdout,
stderr, and execution metadata. Missing or unreadable files get a separate message. The run's More menu offers
**Export…** (a complete ZIP of a finished run) and **Delete Run…**, which asks for
confirmation and removes that finished run's record, prompts, deliveries, and
action outputs; active runs cannot be deleted. Storage totals and **Clear
History…** remain in Settings.

A selected run stays open when it completes, without switching to another run or
resetting the reading position. Only active runs offer recovery and cancellation.
Roles retain their recorded agent icon after execution. An `@pN` link appears only
while that terminal pane exists, even if its agent has exited back to the shell.
Closed panes keep their role and agent icon without an inactive link.

Hovering from History to the bell switches the preview without reopening the old
panel. A click pins the panel; click the other button to switch a pinned panel.
Escape or an outside click dismisses it.

Every run, including `workflow test-action`, stores its runtime data in
`~/.prowl/logs/workflow-runs/<root-name>-<root-hash>/YYYY-MM/<run-id>/`.
The hash identifies the canonical, symlink-resolved execution directory. Worktrees
and clones have separate histories; changing a branch keeps the same identity.
The creation month stays fixed. No project-local runtime files or Git-ignore rules
are created. Personal and team workflow definitions keep their existing locations.

Each run contains `run.json`, `log.md`, its frozen bundle in `definition/`,
`prompts/`, `skills/`, `deliveries/`, and `actions/`. Metadata records the original
execution root. `prowl workflow status <run-id>` finds saved history even after that
root is closed, moved, or deleted. A moved folder does not inherit the old history.

**Settings → Agents → Workflows → Run History** shows how many runs the archive
holds and their size on disk, with **Clear History…**: after confirmation it
deletes every finished run that is not in use, ignoring the retention window.
Active runs are kept. Export (from a run's More menu in Workflow History) creates
a complete ZIP of a finished run; choose a location outside workflow history for
durable results. Outputs and action artifacts inside history expire with their run.

Automatic cleanup removes finished runs three days after completion; there is no
per-run protection and no user-facing retention setting. The global budget is
**5 GiB, soft**: older eligible runs are removed first when history exceeds it.
Runs finished in the last 24 hours, live runs (including Needs Attention),
occupied runs, and ambiguous or unsafe records are protected from automatic
cleanup. Startup and completion trigger background cleanup with a shared
five-minute rate limit. Old project-local data is neither migrated nor deleted.

Both `message` and `launch` require `prompt`; the retired `text` and `instruction`
fields are not accepted. A message waits for an idle agent, then Prowl chooses direct
single-line delivery or scoped read after rendering. Launch uses a kickoff prompt.
`expect` controls whether either step waits for an agent delivery. Saved files in
`prompts/` contain the task body, without generated completion commands.

Agents retrieve assigned prompts and explicit input resources with
`prowl workflow read`, using the run ID, invocation number, and assigned pane. Prowl owns
persistence; deliver text or JSON through `prowl workflow deliver -` on stdin. Run
paths are temporary artifact locations, not durable downstream references.

## Settings → Agents → Workflows

The global page is a compact index of **Built-in** and **Your Workflows**
(`~/.prowl/workflows`) only. A row shows the YAML icon, name, id, description,
and one effective status: **Ready**, **Disabled**, **Invalid**, or
**Superseded**. Select the row to open its detail; the index itself contains no
workflow-specific controls.

Repository workflows live directly in the matching Repository Settings, in a
**Workflows** section immediately after **Agents**. It uses the same compact
rows and the same detail page—there is no intermediate workflow page.

The detail page owns these controls and explanations:

| Section | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Workflow** | identity, effective status, and **Enabled**. Disabled workflows disappear from launch surfaces and `prowl workflow run` refuses them with `WORKFLOW_DISABLED`. Repository settings are keyed by canonical repository root plus workflow id, so the same id in two repositories remains independent. |
| **Run** | **Run in <repository · worktree>** names the actual target and follows the main window's selection whenever the detail appears or the Settings window becomes key. Its menu lists other legal worktrees and **Run with Options…**. Repository workflows only list worktrees from that repository. Every choice uses the same admission path as the other GUI and CLI entry points; if that explicit worktree closes first, Prowl refuses the run instead of falling back to another target. |
| **Roles** | every `current`, `pick`, and `launch` role with a plain-language behavior summary. Only a `launch` role has a **Preferred Agent Profile** menu; **Choose Automatically** forgets the preference and lets Prowl resolve a qualifying profile at start. Unqualified profiles remain visible with the reason but cannot be selected. **Manage Agent Profiles…** appears once per page. |
| **Run Setup** | **Follow Workflow**, **Always Review Before Running**, or **Run Directly When Possible**. The last choice starts immediately only when profiles, required role choices, inputs, and validation are already resolved; otherwise the review sheet still opens. |
| **Validation** | every diagnostic as message, source location, and stable code. Saving the YAML revalidates automatically; there is no separate Validate button. |
| **Source File** | **Open Workflow** uses the default YAML app; the folder button reveals it in Finder. **Delete Workflow…** asks for confirmation, then moves a personal or repository workflow to Trash and returns to the list. Failed deletions keep the detail open with an error. Built-ins are read-only and cannot be deleted. YAML remains the source of truth—Settings does not embed an editor. |

Starting from Settings keeps the review panel in the Settings window. Cancelling
returns to the same detail without bringing the main window or terminal forward.

**New Workflow…** opens a form: a name, an id (suggested from the name as a
lowercase slug, editable, refused when invalid, reserved, or already used here),
an optional SF Symbol icon, and one of two starters. **Single agent** is a prompt
template that asks the current agent for today's date; **Multi-agent** plays
rock-paper-scissors between the current agent and a launched one. Both write a
validated, commented `<id>.pwlworkflow/workflow.yaml` into the current page's
workflow folder — the comments point at this manual and the bundled skill on
disk — and open it in the default YAML app. **Create with Agent…** (on the index
and inside the form) provides a copyable prompt that points a coding agent at
the bundled `prowl-workflow` skill and this manual. From a valid creation form,
the prompt includes the selected starter and its name, ID, and icon, so the agent
can adapt that draft to your task. The form describes the actual starter example
and the editor handoff before you create it. Names containing punctuation or
non-English text are preserved in the YAML file. The folder button reveals
the current workflow folder, creating it when needed.

The page follows its source folders live, so saving, adding, deleting, or
renaming YAML updates the index and an open detail automatically. If an open
file disappears, its detail becomes **Workflow Unavailable** instead of
silently switching to another workflow.

A banner mirrors start admission: Install when `prowl` is missing (Repair for a
dangling link, Reinstall for a foreign non-executable link), or the reason Prowl
is not listening on its socket. The same status appears under Settings → Agents
→ CLI & Skills → Connection.

## Gotchas for agents

- Validate before handing over: `prowl workflow validate <bundle.pwlworkflow>` works with Prowl
  closed and is the static check; Settings shows the same diagnostics plus
  availability warnings (installed runtimes, enabled profiles) that only the
  app can evaluate. Errors, not warnings, make a file unrunnable — and its row
  says so.
- `prowl.*` ids are reserved for built-ins; a user or repo file using one is
  invalid (`reserved_id`).
- Repository workflows are visible only from that repository's worktrees;
  `prowl workflow list` from a pane answers for that pane's worktree.
- A remembered binding is keyed by the role's requirements (`agents`,
  `suggest`, …): editing those in the file forgets the binding; editing prompts
  keeps it.
- Participants must deliver with the exact `prowl workflow deliver …` command Prowl
  typed (token included); `prowl agents dispatch-complete` is refused inside a
  workflow activation with `WORKFLOW_DELIVERY_REQUIRED`.
- Nothing is closed automatically; a launched reviewer pane stays open after the
  run unless the workflow has a `close:` step.

## Script actions and bundles

Local actions live under `actions/<id>/action.yaml` in a `.pwlworkflow` bundle, with scripts,
helpers, and assets beside them. Steps reference `local:<id>` or a registered `builtin:<id>`.
Action inputs and results are typed JSON; validated results appear at
`actions.<step>.output` and `actions.<step>.output_path`. The built-in repository context
writes per-invocation artifacts. `builtin:save-handoff` saves a briefing and generated context
under `.prowl/handoff/`. These actions are also distinct from shell-command Custom Actions.

Scripts have your local user permissions. In Settings > Agents > Workflows, open the bundle's
script review, inspect the source location, interpreter, entrypoint, and changed files, then
approve that version. Approval does not start the workflow. CLI starts and single-action tests
use the same approval; the CLI cannot grant it. Changing or moving a bundle requires review
again. A run uses a fixed definition copy; changes to that copy invalidate execution.

Use `prowl workflow test-action <workflow-id> local:<id> --input-json '{}'` to exercise one
approved action in a real run. Then run the workflow to test its agent interactions and data
flow. Tests have the same side effects as normal execution. Each attempt records its request,
result, metadata, bounded raw stdout/stderr, and artifacts under the run's `actions/<step>/<execution UUID>/`.
Retries create a fresh attempt and can repeat side effects. Cancel and timeout terminate the
owned script process group; neither operation rolls back completed work.

Typed `state` retains values explicitly. Branch and loop iteration results leave scope on
exit. Use state to carry a verdict/path to the next iteration. A loop with no cap is permitted;
a loop whose condition remains true at `max_iterations` ends as `iteration_limit_reached`.
In the condition, `context.step.id` names the loop and `context.step.iteration` is the
completed count, starting at 0. Steps in the body use iteration numbers starting at 1.
A role stays bound for the run: launch it once, then send messages for repeated work.

Install the `prowl-workflow` skill for bundle examples, the action manifest and JSON protocol,
approval guidance, expression rules, and test commands.

When a script bundle needs approval, the workflow start screen provides **Review Bundle…**
and keeps Run disabled. Approval returns to the same start screen; it does not start a run.

## Sandbox access

`workflow read` and `workflow deliver` use the existing Prowl Unix socket. File-read
access and socket access are separate permissions. If the runtime returns
`SOCKET_PERMISSION_DENIED`, use its native approval mechanism for the specific
Prowl command or socket; do not disable sandboxing or grant home-directory access.
An existing `current` or `pick` pane keeps its launch permissions. Prowl does not
retrofit new sandbox grants into it. No project-local staging is automatic.

For isolated Debug acceptance, `PROWL_DEBUG_DATA_DIRECTORY` selects temporary
settings, cache, and workflow-history storage. Use a separate Debug process and
matching `PROWL_CLI_SOCKET`. Release builds ignore this directory override.

### Fixed size limits

| Content | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Action input and `test-action --input-json` | 16 MiB |
| Action stdout | 16 MiB |
| Action stderr | 4 MiB |
| `workflow deliver` body (CLI and App) | 16 MiB of UTF-8 |
| `workflow read` page | 256 KiB; continue with `next_offset` |
| Complete launch prompt, including protocol text | 128 KiB |
| Frozen workflow bundle | 64 MiB / 8192 entries |
| `history.json` | 64 KiB |
| JSON socket frame / serialized action request | 96 MiB + 64 KiB, including escaping and envelope fields |

Action input is measured as compact JSON; request context and JSON escaping have
separate transport headroom. These are Prowl limits; an agent runtime can impose
a smaller launch limit. Larger results should use action artifacts. Individual
artifacts and complete runs have no hard byte cap; the 5 GiB history budget remains soft.

`history.json` holds bounded display and lifecycle fields, separately from full
action/state data in `run.json`. Long workflow names are shortened only in history
metadata. History scans check the record's file identity without decoding its
contents. Missing metadata or a changed record protects the run from cleanup and
export until it can be inspected. Record replacement invalidates the old metadata
before publishing the new pair. No old-history migration or fallback is performed.

## Built-in Handoff

`prowl.handoff` asks the current agent to summarize its task, saves the briefing with
repository and available session context, and optionally launches a receiver in a new tab
and switches focus to it. Select `next=save` to save only; the receiver Profile is then
unnecessary and hidden in the start sheet. The default `next=launch` uses the normal Profile picker without a runtime
restriction. Both source and receiver panes stay open.

Both modes require a source pane with a detected agent to write the briefing. A selected bare
shell cannot start the run; choose another agent pane in the same worktree. With no available
agent pane, start an agent first. The workflow does not create its own author. CLI admission
returns `AGENT_NOT_FOUND` for a bare shell or `SOURCE_REQUIRED` for a missing source pane,
before saving or launching anything.

```bash
prowl workflow run prowl.handoff --role receiver=Codex --json
prowl workflow run prowl.handoff --input next=save --json
```

When an agent starts the workflow itself, it must follow `self_initiated.line` in the response
and deliver its briefing with the supplied token. The run saves nothing until that delivery
passes its required sections. The receiver reads an independent packet under
`.prowl/handoff/archive/workflow-<run UUID>.md`; later handoffs do not change that packet.
`current.md` and `context.md` retain the latest handoff state for workflow inspection.

A completed workflow means the packet was saved and the selected receiver was launched.
It does not certify that the receiver finished the task. A failed launch keeps the packet;
retry the failed step or use the packet manually. Cancelling keeps saved material and panes.
See [Handoff](handoff.md) for storage and session context details.
