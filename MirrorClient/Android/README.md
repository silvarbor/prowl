# Prowl Mirror for Android

Experimental **native Kotlin / Jetpack Compose** text mirror client. One application
supports Android phones and tablets (Android 8.0 / API 26 or later). At 840 dp
available width the pane drawer becomes a persistent sidebar. Both layouts share
session, protocol and rendering code; rotation is supported, not locked.

The Android project lives in `MirrorClient/Android/` in the Prowl repository.
The original Gradle project name and application ID are preserved.

## Connect

Use the matching Prowl `feat/mobile-mirror` Host with `PROWL_REMOTE_MIRROR=1`.
On Mac: Start Host → Add a Device. On Android: Add Remote Pane → enter IP/port
and the two halves of the single-use, 60-second code. The default port is 7880. After enrollment, credentials
are encrypted using Android Keystore and the short code is discarded. Pick a saved
Host and leave code blank on subsequent connections. If the first runtime connection fails
after enrollment, Retry uses the saved device credential without another code.

Select an open pane, or New Agent Pane → workspace → available Host Agent Profile
→ optional initial message. Models and permissions come from that Profile. There
is no private AI console or dependency on personal shell wrappers.

- Active text replaces the last snapshot; it is not an append-only transcript.
- Markdown emphasis/inline code, code fences and tables have readable previews;
  expanding code/table freezes the detail and supports copying the original text.
- Multiline input sends only on Send or two physical Returns within 350 ms.
  IME composition disables Send. Host checks Agent readiness through public dispatch;
  shell Send requires an explicit Host capability. Current Hosts refuse it because
  they cannot verify an empty command line; the draft remains available.
- An unconfirmed delivery preserves the draft and blocks accidental resending.
  Check receipt only queries the original request; it never repeats input.
- Mirror, Retry and foreground reconnection use `ifFree`; Take Over is explicit.
  If another client claims a free pane before Mirror completes, Android reports it busy.
- History is a bounded frozen snapshot with earlier-page loading. Returning to Live
  keeps receiving current output. Closing a mirror never stops the Host program.
- Saving credentials does not persist terminal output or drafts across process death.
  Rotation retains the current ViewModel; reopening the app offers saved Hosts.

## Build and test

Open `MirrorClient/Android/` in Android Studio, or change to that directory
and use JDK 17 and an installed Android
SDK 34. Set `ANDROID_HOME` or create an untracked `local.properties` with `sdk.dir`.

    ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug :app:testDebugUnitTest :app:lintDebug

APK: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.
With an available emulator/device:

    ./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest

Dependencies are pinned to the tested Gradle 8.7 / AGP 8.4.2 / Kotlin 1.9.24 /
Compose compiler 1.5.14 toolchain. This is not yet a Play Store release configuration.
The native TLS interop test is opt-in (`MIRROR_NATIVE_TEST_PORT`) and is skipped
without its external macOS fixture; the normal unit suite must not be described as
executing that fixture. See [validation](docs/validation.md) for actual run evidence.

## Structure

- `Wire.kt`: Swift Codable-compatible controls, bounded binary frames, public commands.
- `Transport.kt`: ECDHE-PSK TLS, challenge proof, enrollment, heartbeat and cancellation.
- `Vault.kt`: device credentials encrypted at rest with an Android Keystore key.
- `Session.kt`, `LaunchModel.kt`: subscriptions, takeover, input receipts, history and creation.
- `Document.kt`: bounded text/code/table parsing and hardware Return gesture.
- `MirrorApp.kt`: adaptive UI; `MainActivity.kt`: retained model and foreground lifecycle.

The shared [wire contract](../../docs/remote-mirror-wire.md) is owned by Prowl. There is no legacy
protocol or 64-hex-code compatibility. Update both ends together.
