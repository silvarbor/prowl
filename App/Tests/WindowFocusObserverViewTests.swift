/// Regression guard for the Shelf-entry focus bug: when a
/// `WindowFocusObserverNSView` is torn off its host window (e.g. one
/// SwiftUI subtree is swapped for another that continues to observe the
/// same `WorktreeTerminalState`), the teardown must NOT fire an
/// "inactive" activity callback. An inactive callback would overwrite
/// the shared state's cached window-key flag and demote the surface's
/// focused bit even though the window is still key.

    // a (key=false, visible=false) inactive signal and poisoned the
    // shared `WorktreeTerminalState`'s cached window-key flag.
